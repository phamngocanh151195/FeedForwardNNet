Feedforward neural network with SGD learning

To run:
- Place all the code and mnist archive in the same folder.
- Check the directory inside mnist_loader.py
- Change config in runNN.py and run it

###Code:
mnist_loader is completely Nielsen's work

Network code is also majorly inspired by him. I have made modifications to make it simpler.
